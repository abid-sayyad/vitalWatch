# â›‘  VitalWatch  - Miner health monitoring system
Each year around thousands of mine workers die due to delay in getting medical assistance. Taking that as our inspiration We have made a platform to monitor health vitals and working environment so that emergency services can be contacted swiftly. 

Our IoT device gathers data like health vitals, Geo-location and environment constants for the worker and provides it to the maintainer.This ensures the maintainer can take quick action in case of mishaps.

We made a realtime connection between the hardware and the software to monitor every possible threat to the worker's life. By using sensors like MQ-X, we are able to receive environmental data like CO, CH4. C2H2 percentage in the Environment, so that we can predict any chances of suffocation to the worker.

We Built VitalWatch using Arduino Mega, SIM 900A, GSM Module, MQ-X Gas sensors, DT11, Temperature and Humidity Sensors, IR contact Less Temperature Sensor and heart Beat Monitor. Our realtime portal is made using React and Express.
